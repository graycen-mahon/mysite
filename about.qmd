About Me:

I grew up in the Bay Area, CA about 15 minutes outside of San Francisco with my parents, two sisters and brother in a town called San Bruno. I have always enjoyed being outside, spending time by myself, cooking, swimming, and playing soccer. Since coming to college at UCSB, I have grown to enjoy spending time with friends, cooking even more, having the occassional beer at M special, and walking on the beach (cliche, I know...). I went vegan in 2019, and I am super passionate about aiding in the fight against climate change through regenerative agriculture and fighting food injustice through small scale farming and the return to indigenous practices.
