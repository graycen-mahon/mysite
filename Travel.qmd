title: "About Me"
---


I have a deep passion for working towards environmental justice, social equity and global health through regenerative agriculture, a return to indigenous stewardship, promoting food sovereignty and the continued elevation of voices that are typically ignored and oppressed. I love to work with people, always be challenged in the workplace, and remain a lifelong learner.
