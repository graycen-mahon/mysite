I love to travel, it's one of my bigest interests and hobbies. At the risk of sounding cliche, I know this is not a new hobby or interest but it is one that brings me an immense amount of joy. I have had the privilege and pleasure of traveling to so many places already, and I keep finding inspiration to explore new places. 

I grew up traveling with my family, mostly to Virginia every summer to see my moms family so it was not until college, actually, that I was able to go to Europe. I studied abroad in Rome, Italy for 4 months and spent my free time and went to as many places as I could; England, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, and the Netherlands. It was such an educational and emotional experience. I mostly traveled on my own, experiencing these places nd forcing myself to get immersed in the culture and the community. Since I was by myself, I had to be social in order to meet friends and not be lonely all the time. I visited so many once in a lifetime sites like the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, Buckingham Palace, the Royal Botanical Gardens in Scotland, and the Guinness Storehouse in Ireland. Alright, so the last one might not be a wonder of the world, but as a beer lover it was pretty damn cool.

I've been on two major road trips in my life, 3 if you could booking it in 2 days from Santa Barbara to Seattle. The first was with my best friend, we camped and drove for 10 days from Santa Barbara to Arizona, up through Utah and Idaho and then back down the way we came and through Las Vegas on the way back here. It was so cool, and we learned so much about the different environments in the United States as well as how to live without showering for 10 days... The second road trip I did with my sister, and we drove across the country to Virgnia to meet up with family. She's 3 years older than me, and had gotten into graduate school in North Carolina. She had mentioned that she did not want to drive by herself across the country and lucky for her I much rather drive than fly- it keeps life interesting. We had such a great time, and I got to see so much of the United States I had never seen before, while also spending quality time with my sister. 

What I've learend from my few travels so far, is that it costs much more than I ever though but it is always worth it. I never thought that as a woman in this world I would be able to travel on my own, but I choose to no longer live in fear and rather be empowered by navigating this complicated world on my own. I find so muhc value in being alone, and traveling has been a catalyst for me to apply that into my daily life.
