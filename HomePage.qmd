Hi! Thanks for stopping by my website, created by yours truly using R Studio- a programming language for statistical computing, graphics and website construction. My name is Graycen Mahon and I am originally from the Bay Area. I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2023, with a Bachelor of Arts in both Environmental Studies and Sociology.

Please explore my page to review my work experiences and writing samples! I am happy to have you here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a deep passion for working towards environmental justice, social equity and global health through regenerative agriculture, a return to indigenous stewardship, promoting food sovereignty and the continued elevation of voices that are typically ignored and oppressed. I love to work with people, always be challenged in the workplace, and remain a lifelong learner.
