    "text": "I love to travel, it’s one of my bigest interests and hobbies. At the risk of sounding cliche, I know this is not a new hobby or interest but it is one that brings me an immense amount of joy. I have had the privilege and pleasure of traveling to so many places already, and I keep finding inspiration to explore new places.\nI grew up traveling with my family, mostly to Virginia every summer to see my moms family so it was not until college, actually, that I was able to go to Europe. I studied abroad in Rome, Italy for 4 months and spent my free time and went to as many places as I could; England, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, and the Netherlands. It was such an educational and emotional experience. I mostly traveled on my own, experiencing these places nd forcing myself to get immersed in the culture and the community. Since I was by myself, I had to be social in order to meet friends and not be lonely all the time. I visited so many once in a lifetime sites like the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, Buckingham Palace, the Royal Botanical Gardens in Scotland, and the Guinness Storehouse in Ireland. Alright, so the last one might not be a wonder of the world, but as a beer lover it was pretty damn cool.\nI’ve been on two major road trips in my life, 3 if you could booking it in 2 days from Santa Barbara to Seattle. The first was with my best friend, we camped and drove for 10 days from Santa Barbara to Arizona, up through Utah and Idaho and then back down the way we came and through Las Vegas on the way back here. It was so cool, and we learned so much about the different environments in the United States as well as how to live without showering for 10 days… The second road trip I did with my sister, and we drove across the country to Virgnia to meet up with family. She’s 3 years older than me, and had gotten into graduate school in North Carolina. She had mentioned that she did not want to drive by herself across the country and lucky for her I much rather drive than fly- it keeps life interesting. We had such a great time, and I got to see so much of the United States I had never seen before, while also spending quality time with my sister.\nWhat I’ve learend from my few travels so far, is that it costs much more than I ever though but it is always worth it. I never thought that as a woman in this world I would be able to travel on my own, but I choose to no longer live in fear and rather be empowered by navigating this complicated world on my own. I find so muhc value in being alone, and traveling has been a catalyst for me to apply that into my daily life."

    "text": "I absolutely adore cooking, I could easily spend hours in the kitchen creating and testing out new vegan recipes that I usually make up in my head. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with an idea and scramble to write it down before drifting off to sleep. I learned to cook at a young age, with my first ever talent being the art of pancakes, taught to me by my father. Both my parents are active in the kitchen, but with my mom home most of the time throughout my upbringing, I learned how to make a lot of her recipes and her family recipes through participation and observation.\nMy mom’s side of the family is Ukranian and Southern Italian, from Sicily, so I learned hot to make a lot of Italian and Eastern European dishes. Through careful observation and occasional participation, I mimicked my mother and learned how to make these recipes myself. I loved to make Pasta Pomodoro e Basilico (pasta wiht tomato and basil) as well as Sicilian Pesto, and now I make it vegan as well. I also deeply enjoy making Halupkies and Varenikis. The former being a cabbage roll containing meat (I use tofu or lentils) with rice that is rolled and placed into a baking dish before being slathered in a rich tomato sauce and served with sour cream. The latter is a dumpling akin to pierogies, and can contain anything from meat and veggies, to potatoes and cheese. I vividly recall my mom telling me stories about my Grandma Rose making hundreds of these every so often and carefully laying them out to dry on linen towels laid out on her bed. She would then freeze them, and make them for her every time they went over. My love of cooking definitely stems from the cultural connection I feel when I make and eat these foods.\nNow, don’t get me wrong, Italy and the Ukraine have incredible rich cultures and histories, but I would say that the richest foods I eat flavor-wise come from my father’s side of the family. My dad was born and raised in Trinidad and Tobago, a small pair of islands about 10 miles off the coast of Venezuela in the Caribbean. Growing up I ate a lot of curries and stews, with intense flavors and spice. Even though my dad worked so much throughout the week, he was always around and active with us on the weekends. He would spend all day making curry chicken, while me and my siblings ran around burning up excess excitement and impatience. It was always the sign of a great day when my dad would pull out the roti and the coconut milk, as we all knew what was to come.\nCooking is and will always be a part of my life, and I believe that food is incredibly healing. I find that I feel less homesick, happier, and better connected to my ancestors when I have access to my kitchen and when I am able to make these cultural foods. My joy and love for cooking grew exponentially after becoming vegan, with new excitement in recreating old family recipes and making some of my own."
